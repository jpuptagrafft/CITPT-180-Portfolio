            <p id="firstP">Hello there, My name is James Uptagrafft. I was born in Lewiston, Idaho, and Iâ€™m also currently living in Lewiston as well. As a child, I was always enamored by computers. As I grew older, this love evolved into a want to understand how these machines worked. However, my upbringing never allowed for this to happen due to financial strain, and the most advanced Computer Science class my High school had available was a course in GIMP (the GNU Image Manipulation Program) for basic image editing. This changed when I entered higher education.</p>
            <p> I started at the Clarkston Branch of Walla Walla Community College to achieve a simple Transfer AA, then moved to Lewis-Clark State College, where I picked up every single Computer Science class I could get my hands on. During this time, I picked up knowledge in C, C++, C#, Python, SQL, Java, Swift, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP, along with learning how to use Harp, Jekyll, Hugo, Ionic, Git and Xcode, as well as concepts such as Networking, Editing Linux Kernels, Image Analysis, Game Design & Development, Game Engine Design, and App Development. This created an odd situation where I took the senior project class during my Junior Year, and then had to learn never before used skills on the fly due to an unexpected turn of events, but you can learn more about that in the Projects Section of this Website, or my Github repository.</p>
            <p>Currently, I am looking for a Job within the field of Computer Science, so that I may work in a field that I am deeply passionate about.</p>
